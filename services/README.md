<p> The model clusters around a 1000 user-profiles in around 4 seconds. It also allocates them into teams of particular team sizes<p>

<br/>

## Workflow: 

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
Here the text is tokenized and then converted into a vector using TF-IDF <i>(term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency)</i> vectorizer.

### 2. K-means Clustering:
The vectorized text is then clustered using K-means clustering algorithm. The optimum number of clusters is determined by the use of silhouette scores evaluation over a range of K- values.

### 3. Huntly Team Allocation:
The clusters are then allocated into teams of particular team sizes. The team allocation is done by the use of a greedy algorithm which allocates the users with the highest similarity scores to the team first.
